Interest rates: Your interest rate will affect the total cost of the loan. The lower your interest rate, the lower your total loan cost. Compare several loan offers to ensure you get the best deal.
Fees and charges: Some lenders add significant fees to their loans. If you’re applying for a $500 loan, these charges might be a significant portion of the money you’ll have to repay.16
Loan terms: Shorter loan terms result in higher monthly payments but lower total loan costs. If you take out a small loan with a high interest rate, make sure you pay it back as quickly as possible.
 Funding time: Most loans will take at least a few days to process, although with some loan apps, you can speed up the process by paying a fee.

 A payday loan is a type of short-term borrowing where a lender will extend high-interest credit based on your income. Its principal is typically a portion of your next paycheck.

Payday loans charge high interest rates for short-term, immediate credit. They are also called cash advance loans or check advance loans.

Payday loans can also be useful in an emergency, such as to pay for vehicle repairs or medical bills. However, they also have high interest rates and may have high penalties if you fail to pay them back on time.

Payday loans aren’t considered a good solution to financial difficulties and aren’t legal in all states.
